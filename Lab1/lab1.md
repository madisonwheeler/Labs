**c. 2)** 
      * One suggestion I have is to do research on the person you're asking the question to. Make sure the person 
        you're asking is of the right skill level to answer your question.
      * A second suggestion I have is to ask your question with confidence, but don't be too overconfident. The more 
        informed you are about the question you are about to ask the easier it will be to be confident. The less 
        hesitant you are the more likely people will be receptive to your question.

**c. 3)** Reading that chapter really surprised me, mostly because I've never heard of Jesse or his story before.
          I feel like I should have known about his story as a Computer Science major at RPI. One thing I got out 
          of this chapter is a reminder to be careful about what you make and release, and to always plan for the worst
          case scenario. I think what happened to Jesse was really unfair and ultimately falls under this issue
          of whether we should value intent or actions more, especially in a legal sense. When is comes to software
          and applications it's always a grey area of whether or not the creators of these platforms are responsible 
          for the unintended actions of their users. Personally I'm not 100% set on either side and think it matters 
          on a case by case basis. In this case I believe that Jesse's intent should of been taken into consideration 
          more than the actions of the users of Jesse's search engine. Despite being frustrated by Jesse's situation, 
          the chapter inspired me, specifically because it's a story about an RPI student who created something important
          and useful.

e. Regex

In your Foundations of Computer Science class you learned about Regular expressions. (If you have not taken Foundations of Computer Science class, please talk to the instructor for an explanation)
Please do all the practice problems given here (moving over Interactive Tutorial in the top right corner will get this).
To get full credit, do at least 7 problems.
Take a screenshot and add to lab1.md
Go through the tutorials here
Do all the problems and at least four problems on beginner level here.
Take a screenshot and add to lab1.md
(Optional But Recommended) Do problem 11 in adventofcode 2015 (You may use regular expression) http://adventofcode.com/2015/day/11
f. Play with Snap or CSDT or Blockly

Create some thing using either of the first two or solve this using blockly
Add to lab1.md

**g.** So far I don't have a specific project/problem that intrests me but I am searching for projects. Right now, I 
       am searching for projects using the GitHub Explore page as well as
